# Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Using Linear Regression

This project uses linear regression techniques to predict the likelihood of Type 2 diabetes based on key health metrics such as age, body mass index (BMI), glucose levels, insulin, and blood pressure. The dataset, sourced from healthcare studies, serves as the foundation for the model, providing a way to estimate the probability of diabetes in individuals based on their medical history and physiological data.

## Objective 
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine the likelihood of an individual developing Type 2 diabetes. This model can potentially be used for early diagnosis, helping medical professionals identify high-risk individuals and recommend timely interventions to prevent the disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a variety of health-related features, including:
- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a key indicator of obesity.
- **Glucose levels**: The glucose level measurement, which is a critical factor in diabetes.
- Other features include insulin levels, blood pressure, and skin thickness.

## Technologies
- **Python**: A powerful programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An open-source web application for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and more.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, providing essential tools to handle and clean the dataset.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including the implementation of linear regression models.
